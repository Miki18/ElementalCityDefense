# Elemental City Defense

**Elemental City Defense** (version 1.0.0) is a game made by one person. You goal is to stop monsters before they enter to city.

# Basic

To stop monsters you need to buy tower and place them in the right side of the map. You can also built walls to protect your towers.
Monsters come from left to right.

# Levels

There are 10 levels. You can't let monsters enter the city.
There is also endless mode.

After each level (except endless and the last level) game save your progress and it will load it when you launch game again.

# Towers

To buy a new tower, you need 100 gold. New towers always are neutral and have 0 level.
You can place tower on 10th positions - click where you want to place your tower and click "place" on your widget. You can remove it in the same way.

Upgrading towers increase their damage and health. It also repair them.

# Walls

You can place walls right before towers. However when you buy wall it is glued to this specific place (you are not able to move it). Walls can't give enemies any damage, but they have more health than towers.

# Monsters

There are 5 types of monsters:
- ent (neutral elemental)
- fire elemental
- earth elemental
- water elemental
- wind elemental

Every elemental have 3 variants: normal, fast and big. Fast is the fastest, but has the lowest health, big has a lot of health, but it is also very slow. Normal variant is somewhere between fast and big.

Every elemental (except ents) have some weakness and strengths. It also has resistance and is vulnerable for specific elementals.

# Gold

You have 200 gold at start. You will need it to buy/upgrade towers and walls.

Gold can be earned by:
  - sell towers
  - kill monsters

# Elements

Every elemental (except ents) has resistance for specific element, but other is their weakness. Player can give his towers element power (when you buy a new tower, it has neutral element). Each tower can have only one element and you can't change it later. Therefore you need to place towers with right element there, where this element is needed.
Walls can't have element power.
